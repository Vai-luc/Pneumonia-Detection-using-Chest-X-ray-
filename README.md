### üìå **Project Title**

**Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Pneumonia Detection Using Chest X-rays**

---

### üìù **Detailed Description**

This project presents a hybrid deep learning approach for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images, combining the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and traditional machine learning techniques to improve diagnostic accuracy and model generalization.

Using a labeled chest X-ray dataset of patients with and without pneumonia, the model pipeline includes image preprocessing, feature extraction, hybrid architecture training, and evaluation. The main goal is to build a lightweight yet accurate model that can assist medical professionals in early and reliable pneumonia detection.

Key steps in the project include:

* üìÅ **Data Preprocessing**: X-ray images were resized, normalized, and augmented (flipping, rotation, noise injection) to balance the dataset and reduce overfitting.
* üß† **Model Architecture**:

  * A **CNN backbone** was used to extract deep spatial features.
  * Features were optionally passed through traditional classifiers like **Random Forest** or **XGBoost** to compare performance with end-to-end deep learning.
* üß™ **Training & Evaluation**:

  * Trained using `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch` with `binary_crossentropy` as the loss function.
  * Evaluation metrics included **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **AUC-ROC** to measure medical diagnostic reliability.
* üìä **Results & Visualization**:

  * Confusion matrices, ROC curves, and loss/accuracy graphs were plotted to interpret performance.
  * The hybrid model achieved over **92% accuracy**, with improved generalization on unseen data.

### üîß **Tools & Technologies Used**

* Python, TensorFlow / PyTorch, Scikit-learn
* OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

### ‚úÖ **Outcome**

The project demonstrates an effective hybrid diagnostic model for pneumonia detection that combines the robustness of CNNs with the interpretability and stability of ensemble classifiers. It also emphasizes best practices in medical ML: clean pipelines, performance metrics beyond accuracy, and reproducible workflows.
