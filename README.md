# Hybrid Pneumonia Detection Model

This project implements a hybrid deep learning and machine learning model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The goal is to build an accurate, lightweight, and interpretable diagnostic tool that can support early detection of pneumonia, especially in resource-constrained medical environments.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Using chest X-ray datasets, the project explores:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction
- Traditional classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost) on CNN embeddings
- Comparative analysis of hybrid vs. pure deep learning models

## 📌 Key Features

- Image preprocessing with data augmentation for robustness
- CNN-based deep feature extraction
- Integration with classical ML classifiers
- Visualization: confusion matrix, ROC curves, classification reports
- Achieved over **92% accuracy** with reliable recall and precision

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy, Pandas
- OpenCV, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset

- Chest X-ray images (publicly available datasets like NIH or Kaggle)
- Classes: Normal and Pneumonia

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vai-luc/pneumonia-detection-model.git
cd pneumonia-detection-model
````

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Hybrid_Pneumonia_model.ipynb
```
